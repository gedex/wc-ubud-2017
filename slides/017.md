## UI test

### Writing tests

* Use Selenium WebDriver client to interact with the browser
* Use any test framework you like ([Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), etc). Selenium WebDriver JS client provides testing framework too.
* Provide configuration for things like URL of test site, user credentials, etc.
