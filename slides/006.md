## What is e2e test?

* The feature / spec is human readable. The language is called [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin).
* As a tester I know what to verify. I open browser, visit the page, do some
  some actions as instructed, and verify the outcome matches the expectation.
* Can we test the feature like unit test? You bet!
