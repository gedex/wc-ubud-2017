## UI test

### Selenium

* Selenium is a browser automation library.
* Most often used for testing web-applications, Selenium may be used for any
  task that requires automating interaction with the browser.
* More info http://www.seleniumhq.org/.
* The official site can be confusing for a  newcomer. Lots of tools. Pay attention
  to WebDriver only.
