## UI test

### Selenium WebDriver

* Client communicates with the driver (server or proxy) that implements W3C WebDriver
  standard ([chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/), [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver), etc). Driver translates the command from
  client to the browser.
* The driver can be distributed separately (as a binary) or part of the browser.
